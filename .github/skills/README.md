# 📚 Skills Framework for CIA Compliance Manager

Strategic, rule-based skills that guide all Copilot agents and development in the **CIA Compliance Manager** project.

## What Are Skills?

Skills are **strategic principles** (the *what* and *why*) that define rules for code quality, security, testing, and compliance. They are rule-based documents using a MUST/SHOULD/MAY hierarchy that all agents and developers follow.

**Key distinction**: Skills define *what to do* (principles). Agents define *how to do it* (execution).

| Aspect | Skills | Agents |
|--------|--------|--------|
| **Level** | Strategic — high-level principles | Tactical — task execution |
| **Scope** | Cross-cutting, apply everywhere | Domain-specific focus |
| **Content** | Rules (MUST/SHOULD/MAY) | Instructions for specific tasks |
| **Location** | `.github/skills/` | `.github/agents/` |
| **Example** | "MUST validate all inputs" | "When reviewing code, check input validation" |

### How Skills Work

1. **Before code changes**: Developer or agent consults relevant skills
2. **During implementation**: Skills rules guide decisions (no `any` types, 80%+ coverage, etc.)
3. **Before commit**: Skills checklist validates compliance
4. **During review**: Reviewers check against skill rules

## Rule Hierarchy

Skills use MUST/SHOULD/MAY enforcement:

| Level | Meaning | Enforcement |
|-------|---------|-------------|
| **MUST** | Non-negotiable requirement | Block PR if violated |
| **SHOULD** | Strongly recommended | Justify if skipped |
| **MAY** | Best practice | Optional |

## Quick Start

1. **Before any code change**: Check relevant skills for rules
2. **ALWAYS check reusability**: Search `src/types/`, `src/utils/`, `src/services/` before creating new code
3. **Run checks**: `npm run lint && npm run test && npm run build`
4. **Verify compliance**: No `any` types, 80%+ coverage, JSDoc for public APIs
