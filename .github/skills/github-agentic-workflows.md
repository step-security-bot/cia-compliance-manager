## What Are GitHub Agentic Workflows?

**GitHub Agentic Workflows** (`gh-aw`) is a Go-based GitHub CLI extension that enables writing agentic workflows in natural language using Markdown files, and running them as GitHub Actions workflows. Unlike traditional YAML-based CI/CD, agentic workflows use AI engines (Copilot, Claude, Codex, Gemini) to understand context and make decisions autonomously.

They augment existing deterministic CI/CD with **Continuous AI** capabilities — systematic, automated application of AI to software collaboration. Developed by GitHub Next and Microsoft Research, workflows run with added guardrails, using safe outputs and sandboxed execution.

| Traditional Workflows | Agentic Workflows |
|----------------------|-------------------|
| Fixed YAML with if/then logic | Natural language Markdown instructions |
| Pre-programmed steps | AI interprets context and decides actions |
| Brittle to context changes | Adapts to situation dynamically |
| Requires explicit conditionals | Infers appropriate behavior |
| Limited to coded scenarios | Handles novel situations |

---

## Core Concepts

### 1. Workflow Structure

Every agentic workflow is a Markdown file with YAML frontmatter + natural language instructions:

```yaml
---
timeout-minutes: 5
on: issues
permissions:
  issues: read
tools:
  github:
    toolsets: [default, labels]
safe-outputs:
  add-labels:
    allowed: [bug, feature, enhancement, documentation]
  create-issue-comment: {}
network: defaults
strict: true
---
```

```markdown
# Issue Triage Agent

When a new issue is created:
1. Analyze the issue content, title, and linked resources
2. Determine if it's a bug report, feature request, or question
3. Apply appropriate labels
4. Leave a helpful comment with next steps
```

### 2. Agentic Engines

Supported AI engines (v0.45+):

| Engine | Best For | Notes |
|--------|----------|-------|
| **Copilot** (default) | Code analysis, GitHub operations | Well-integrated, uses Copilot CLI |
| **Claude** | Complex reasoning, long context | Strong analytical capabilities |
| **Codex** | Code generation | OpenAI-based |
| **Gemini** | Multi-modal analysis | Google AI, requires Gemini API access |

```yaml
---
engine: copilot  # or 'claude', 'codex', 'gemini'
# Note: Each engine may require specific API keys or permissions.
# Copilot uses GitHub's built-in integration (default).
# Claude requires Anthropic API access.
# Codex requires OpenAI API access.
# Gemini requires Google AI API access.
---
```

### 3. Compilation & Lock Files

Markdown workflows compile to GitHub Actions YAML:

```bash
gh aw compile                # Compile all workflows
gh aw add-wizard <url>       # Add workflow from gallery
```

**Both files must be committed**: `.md` (source of truth) + `.lock.yml` (compiled workflow with security hardening).

### 4. Safe Outputs (Critical Security Pattern)

The AI runs with **read-only permissions** and produces structured output describing intended actions. A separate job with scoped write permissions executes validated requests.

```yaml
---
safe-outputs:
  create-issue-comment:
    max: 5                    # Rate limit
  create-issue:
    max: 3
    title-prefix: "[auto] "  # Required prefix
    labels: [automated]       # Required labels
  create-pull-request:
    max: 1
  add-labels:
    allowed: [bug, feature]   # Whitelist
  update-project:
    github-token: ${{ secrets.GH_PROJECT_TOKEN }}
    max: 10
  close-older-issues: true    # Auto-close previous runs
  threat-detection:
    enabled: true              # Default, be explicit
---
```

### 5. Safe Inputs

Custom MCP tools defined inline with controlled secret access:

```yaml
---
safe-inputs:
  fetch-api-data:
    description: Fetch data from internal API
    schema:
      type: object
      properties:
        endpoint: { type: string }
      required: [endpoint]
    implementation: |
      const response = await fetch(inputs.endpoint, {
        headers: { 'Authorization': `Bearer ${process.env.API_KEY}` }
      });
      return await response.json();
    env:
      API_KEY: ${{ secrets.INTERNAL_API_KEY }}
---
```

### 6. Model Context Protocol (MCP)

MCP is the standardized protocol (JSON-RPC 2.0) for AI agents to securely connect to external tools — "USB-C for AI integrations."

**Components**: MCP Servers (expose tools) → MCP Gateway (proxy) → MCP Clients (AI agents)

**GitHub MCP Toolsets** (v0.45+):

| Toolset | Key Tools |
|---------|-----------|
| `default` | context, repos, issues, pull_requests |
| `discussions` | list/create/update discussions |
| `actions` | workflows, logs, trigger runs |
| `projects` | GitHub Projects v2 boards |
| `security` | CodeQL, Dependabot, secret scanning |
| `stars` | star/unstar repositories |
| `notifications` | list/mark notifications |
| `gists` | create/list gists |
| `labels` | add/remove labels |

```yaml
---
tools:
  github:
    toolsets: [default, projects, security]
---
```

**Best Practice**: Use `toolsets:` (version-safe) instead of explicit tool lists.

---

## Security Architecture (Defense-in-Depth)

Five security layers protect against prompt injection, rogue MCP servers, and malicious agents:

```
📥 Event → 🔒 Read-only AI Agent (sandboxed, firewalled)
         → 📤 Proposed Output (artifact)
         → 🛡️ Threat Detection (AI-powered scan)
         → ✅ Write Job (scoped token) → GitHub API
         → ❌ Blocked (if suspicious)
```

### Layer 1: Read-Only Tokens
The AI agent receives read-only GitHub tokens. It cannot push, create PRs, or delete files directly.

### Layer 2: Zero Secrets in Agent
Agent process never receives write tokens, API keys, or credentials. Secrets exist only in separate safe-outputs jobs.

### Layer 3: Containerized with Network Firewall
Agent runs in isolated container. **Agent Workflow Firewall (AWF)** routes all outbound traffic through Squid proxy with domain allowlist. Non-listed traffic dropped at kernel level.

### Layer 4: Safe Outputs with Guardrails
Agent produces structured artifact describing intended actions. A gated job decides: hard limits per operation, required prefixes, label constraints.

### Layer 5: Agentic Threat Detection
AI-powered scan checks proposed changes for prompt injection, leaked credentials, and malicious code patterns before any write occurs.

## Implementation Rules

### MUST Rules (Non-Negotiable)

1. **✅ MUST use safe outputs pattern** — Never grant write permissions directly to AI jobs
2. **✅ MUST enable threat detection** — `threat-detection: { enabled: true }`
3. **✅ MUST use network controls** — `network: defaults` or explicit allowlist
4. **✅ MUST validate all inputs** — Schema validation via safe-inputs
5. **✅ MUST use least-privilege** — Minimal permissions, scoped tokens
6. **✅ MUST protect secrets** — GitHub secrets only, never hardcoded, only in safe-outputs jobs
7. **✅ MUST compile before commit** — `gh aw compile` → commit both `.md` + `.lock.yml`
8. **✅ MUST test in isolation** — TrialOps pattern before production
9. **✅ MUST follow OWASP Top 10 for Agentic Applications 2026**
10. **✅ MUST document threat models** — Include in workflow comments
11. **✅ MUST implement human approval** for critical actions (repo settings, access control)
12. **✅ MUST set rate limits** on all safe output types

### SHOULD Rules (Strongly Recommended)

1. **✅ SHOULD use toolsets** instead of explicit tool lists — `toolsets: [default]` is version-safe
2. **✅ SHOULD enable strict mode** — `strict: true`
3. **✅ SHOULD use workflow labels** — `labels: ["automation", "triage"]`
4. **✅ SHOULD implement concurrency controls** — `concurrency: { group: name, cancel-in-progress: true }`
5. **✅ SHOULD set timeout limits** — `timeout-minutes: 30`
6. **✅ SHOULD use memory for stateful workflows** — `cache-memory: { namespace: state }` (7-day retention)
7. **✅ SHOULD document workflow purpose** — Purpose, Trigger, Actions, Owner
8. **✅ SHOULD use orchestrator/worker pattern** for complex tasks
9. **✅ SHOULD version control agent prompts** — Store in `.github/agents/`
10. **✅ SHOULD monitor costs** — `gh aw logs --analyze`

### MAY Rules (Best Practice)

1. **✅ MAY use custom MCP servers** — With security review
2. **✅ MAY use repo-memory** — `repo-memory: { branch: "data/state" }` for long-term persistence
3. **✅ MAY use slash commands** — `on: { slash_command: { command: "/review" } }` for ChatOps
4. **✅ MAY use asset uploads** — `upload-asset: { branch: "assets/reports", allowed-exts: [.png, .pdf] }`

---

## Operational Patterns

| Pattern | Trigger | Description | Key Use Cases |
|---------|---------|-------------|---------------|
| **ChatOps** | `slash_command` | Interactive `/commands` in comments | Code reviews, analysis |
| **DailyOps** | `daily` | Scheduled daily improvements | Doc maintenance, tech debt |
| **IssueOps** | `issues` | Automated on issue creation | Auto-triage, smart routing |
| **LabelOps** | `issues: [labeled]` | Triggered by label changes | Priority handling, routing |
| **MemoryOps** | `weekly` | Stateful with persistent data | Trend analysis, metrics |
| **ProjectOps** | `issues`/`pull_request` | GitHub Projects management | Auto-assignment, status |
| **SideRepoOps** | `workflow_dispatch` | From separate repo | Safe experimentation |
| **TrialOps** | `workflow_dispatch` | Isolated testing | Prompt validation, demos |

**Selection Guide**: Start with TrialOps → Promote to IssueOps/DailyOps → Scale to MemoryOps/ProjectOps → Use ChatOps for interactive.

### Key Lessons from Production

1. **Specialization > Monolith**: Focused agents outperform single all-purpose agents
2. **Guardrails Enable Innovation**: Strict constraints make experimentation safe
3. **Meta-Agents Are Valuable**: Agents that monitor other agents are incredibly useful
4. **Context Is Key**: Customized agents beat generic ones
5. **Observability Is Essential**: All actions must create visible, traceable artifacts
6. **Incremental Progress Beats Heroics**: Small daily improvements compound over time
7. **Cost-Quality Tradeoffs Are Real**: Longer analyses aren't always better

### High-Impact Workflow Examples

**Plan Command** (`/plan`): Breaks complex issues into actionable sub-tasks.
- 514 merged PRs out of 761 proposed (67% merge rate)
- Highest-volume workflow by attribution in the factory
