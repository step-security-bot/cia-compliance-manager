<div class="mindmap-legend">
The mindmaps above provide three different perspectives on the CIA Compliance Manager:

1. **System Overview** - Shows the core components, security levels, and key features of the CIA triad components, business analysis domains, compliance frameworks, and architecture layers
2. **Technical Implementation** - Focuses on the technology stack and implementation details including core frameworks, testing approaches, and development processes
3. **Business Value** - Illustrates how the system delivers value to stakeholders through strategic planning, business case development, and decision support

These visualizations complement the C4 diagrams by providing a different way to understand the system's structure and purpose. While the visual styling through CSS classes isn't available in GitHub's Mermaid implementation, the hierarchical organization of concepts provides clarity on relationships and categories.

**Color Legend (conceptual):**
