These state diagrams illustrate the future behavior and state transitions of the CIA Compliance Manager system, focusing on:

1. **Context-Aware Security Assessment**: How organizational context will drive adaptive security profiles
2. **Adaptive Compliance Management**: How continuous compliance monitoring will replace static point-in-time assessments
3. **Machine Learning Enhancement**: How the system will improve recommendations through continuous learning

The color schemes provide visual distinction between different process phases:

- 🔵 Blues represent mapping and data collection activities
- 🟢 Greens represent assessment and training operations
- 🟣 Purples represent optimization and reporting functions
- 🟠 Oranges/yellows represent active states like deployment and monitoring
- 🔴 Reds represent monitoring and alerting functions
