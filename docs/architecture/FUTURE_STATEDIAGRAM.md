# CIA Compliance Manager Future State Diagrams

This document illustrates the future state transitions and behavior of the enhanced CIA Compliance Manager system, focused on context awareness, adaptive security, and dynamic compliance.

## Context-Aware Security Assessment State Diagram

**Business Focus:** Demonstrates how the system will adapt security assessments based on organization context factors, showing how recommendations and security profiles will dynamically adjust as business context changes.

**Security Focus:** Illustrates the relationship between organizational context factors and resulting security profiles, showing transitions between different context-influenced security states.

These state diagrams illustrate the future behavior and state transitions of the CIA Compliance Manager system, focusing on:

1. **Context-Aware Security Assessment**: How organizational context will drive adaptive security profiles
2. **Adaptive Compliance Management**: How continuous compliance monitoring will replace static point-in-time assessments
3. **Machine Learning Enhancement**: How the system will improve recommendations through continuous learning

The color schemes provide visual distinction between different process phases:

- Blues represent mapping and data collection activities
- Greens represent assessment and training operations
- Purples represent optimization and reporting functions
- Oranges/yellows represent active states like deployment and monitoring
- Reds represent monitoring and alerting functions
