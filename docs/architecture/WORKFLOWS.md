    class PH,PS,AV,AS,OT practice
    class HG,DS,AA,CH implementation
```

### Specific Hardening Measures

The project employs the following security hardening techniques in its workflows:

1. **🔒 Permissions Restriction**: Every workflow uses the principle of least privilege with explicit permissions declarations
   
   ```yaml
   permissions:
     contents: read
     actions: read
     checks: write
     pull-requests: write
   ```

2. **📌 SHA Pinning**: External actions are pinned to specific SHA hashes for immutability
   
   ```yaml
   - uses: actions/checkout@8ade135a41bc03ea155e62e844d188df1ea18608 # v4.1.0
   ```

3. **🪄 StepSecurity Auto-hardening**: Workflows are periodically scanned and updated with StepSecurity best practices

4. **📜 SBOM Generation**: Software Bill of Materials is generated during the release process for transparency

5. **✅ Attestation Creation**: Build and dependency attestations are created and signed during release

6. **⏱️ Timeout Limits**: All jobs have appropriate timeout limits to prevent resource exhaustion

7. **🔑 OIDC Token Usage**: GitHub OIDC tokens are used for secure authenticated deployments instead of long-lived secrets

## 🧪 Test and Report Workflow

The test-and-report workflow runs comprehensive testing and generates quality metrics for pull requests and pushes to the main branch. The workflow consists of 5 distinct jobs that run in a coordinated pipeline:

### Workflow Jobs

**1. Prepare Job**
- Sets up the base environment and installs dependencies
- Caches apt packages, npm dependencies, and Cypress binary
- Verifies Cypress installation
- Prepares the environment for parallel test execution

**2. Build Validation Job** (depends on prepare)
- Validates the application can build successfully
- Runs license compliance checks
- Creates and uploads build artifacts
- Blocks pipeline if build fails or licenses are non-compliant

**3. Unit Tests Job** (depends on prepare, build-validation)
- Executes Vitest unit tests with coverage measurement
- Runs in xvfb (headless display) for component tests
- Generates coverage reports (lcov, html, json)
- Uploads coverage artifacts for analysis

**4. E2E Tests Job** (depends on prepare, build-validation)
- Runs Cypress end-to-end tests in headless mode
- Executes in xvfb with 1280x720x24 screen resolution
- Captures videos and screenshots of test execution
- Uploads Cypress results, videos, and screenshots

**5. Report Job** (depends on unit-tests, e2e-tests, runs always)
- Aggregates results from all test jobs
- Downloads all test artifacts
- Generates combined test reports
- Always runs even if tests fail to capture failure data

```

### Test Workflow Implementation

The test-and-report workflow is implemented with comprehensive job coordination:

**Prepare Job Steps:**
1. **Harden Runner**: StepSecurity runner hardening with egress policy audit
2. **Repository Checkout**: Securely checks out code with proper permissions
3. **Node.js Setup**: Sets up Node.js 25 environment with npm caching
4. **Apt Package Caching**: Caches system packages for faster builds
5. **Display Setup**: Configures xvfb and GUI dependencies for headless testing
6. **Dependency Caching**: Multi-level caching (npm, Cypress binary)
7. **Dependency Installation**: Installs npm packages with `npm install`
8. **Cypress Verification**: Validates Cypress binary installation

**Build Validation Job Steps:**
1. **Harden Runner**: Security hardening of the build environment
2. **Environment Setup**: Node.js 25 with dependency caching
3. **Dependency Installation**: Uses `npm ci` for clean install
4. **Application Build**: Executes production build with `npm run build`
5. **License Verification**: Runs `npm run test:licenses` to ensure compliance
6. **Artifact Upload**: Uploads build output for downstream jobs

**Unit Tests Job Steps:**
1. **Environment Preparation**: Setup with caching and dependencies
2. **Unit Test Execution**: Runs `npm run test:ci` with xvfb for headless testing
3. **Coverage Generation**: Creates lcov, html, and json coverage reports
4. **Artifact Upload**: Uploads coverage reports to build/coverage directory

**E2E Tests Job Steps:**
1. **Environment Setup**: Node.js, dependencies, and Cypress binary caching
2. **Cypress Test Execution**: Runs `npm run test:e2e` in xvfb (1280x720x24)
3. **Video Recording**: Captures test execution videos (CYPRESS_VIDEO=true)
4. **Screenshot Capture**: Takes screenshots on test failures
5. **Result Upload**: Uploads videos, screenshots, and test results

**Report Job Steps:**
1. **Artifact Collection**: Downloads all artifacts from previous jobs
2. **Report Aggregation**: Combines coverage and test results
3. **Unified Upload**: Creates comprehensive test-reports artifact

### Pipeline Execution Flow

The jobs execute in the following dependency order:
```
prepare → build-validation → unit-tests ↘
                          ↘ e2e-tests   → report
```

Both unit-tests and e2e-tests run in parallel after build-validation completes, maximizing pipeline efficiency.

### Test Report and Metrics Generation

The workflow automatically generates and publishes the following metrics and reports:

1. **Code Coverage**: Vitest generates detailed code coverage reports showing statement, branch, function, and line coverage.

2. **Test Results**: All test results are aggregated and published as GitHub artifacts and comments on PRs.

3. **Performance Metrics**: Key performance metrics including:
   - Test execution times
   - Build performance metrics
   - Component rendering benchmarks

4. **Quality Gates**: The workflow enforces quality gates including:
   - Minimum 80% code coverage threshold
   - Zero failing tests
   - No TypeScript or linting errors
   - All security checks passing

   - Provides a complete inventory of all dependencies
   - Includes versions, licenses, and package metadata
   - Published as a release artifact
   - Used for vulnerability tracking

2. **🔏 Build Attestations**: The release workflow creates and signs attestations:
   - Build provenance attestations using SLSA framework
   - Dependency attestation documenting package sources
   - All attestations stored with release artifacts

3. **📈 Coverage Reports**: The test-and-report workflow generates and publishes:
   - Code coverage reports from Vitest
   - Unit and integration test results
   - Performance test metrics

4. **🔍 Security Scanning Results**: Multiple security scanning outputs are produced:
   - CodeQL vulnerability reports
   - ZAP scan findings
   - Dependency vulnerability assessments
   - OSSF Scorecard with supply chain security metrics

## 🚀 Release Workflow

The release workflow handles the build, attestation, and deployment process for new versions. It consists of 3 coordinated jobs that ensure comprehensive testing, security attestation, and reliable deployment.

### Release Workflow Structure

**Triggers:**
- **Manual Workflow Dispatch**: Allows manual triggering with version input (vX.Y.Z format) and prerelease flag
- **Tag Push**: Automatically triggered when version tags (v*) are pushed to the repository

**Job Architecture:**
```
prepare → build → release
```

**1. Prepare Release Job**

This job handles environment preparation, testing, and documentation generation:

**Key Steps:**
1. **Environment Setup**: Ubuntu latest with Node.js 25, dependency caching
2. **Version Detection**: Extracts version from tag or workflow input
3. **Display Configuration**: Sets up xvfb for headless Cypress testing
4. **Dependency Installation**: Full `npm ci` with audit
5. **Version Bumping**: Updates package.json version for workflow dispatch releases
6. **License Verification**: Ensures all dependencies have acceptable licenses (`npm run test:licenses`)
7. **Cypress Testing**: Full E2E test suite in xvfb environment
8. **Coverage Generation**: Runs `npm run coverage` for test coverage
9. **Documentation Bundle**: Generates complete documentation with `npm run docs:bundle`
10. **E2E Report Generation**: Creates merged and HTML E2E test reports
11. **Test Results Copy**: Moves coverage, cypress, and test-results to docs directory
12. **Documentation Deployment**: Deploys documentation to GitHub Pages (main branch)

**Outputs:**
- `version`: Extracted or provided version string
- `is_prerelease`: Boolean flag for prerelease status

**2. Build Release Package Job** (depends on prepare)

This job creates the production build with full SLSA Level 3 attestation:

**Key Steps:**
1. **Repository Checkout**: Checks out the appropriate ref (tag or branch)
2. **Environment Setup**: Node.js 25 with comprehensive caching
3. **Dependency Installation**: Clean install with `npm ci`
4. **Production Build**: Creates optimized build with version embedding
5. **Artifact Creation**: Zips build directory for distribution
6. **SBOM Generation**: Creates SPDX JSON format Software Bill of Materials
7. **Build Attestation**: Generates SLSA build provenance attestation
8. **SBOM Attestation**: Creates attestation for the SBOM document

**Security Features:**
- OIDC authentication for attestation signing
- Cryptographic proof of build provenance
- Complete dependency inventory
- Immutable artifact records

**Artifacts:**
- `build-artifacts`: Application zip and build directory
- `security-artifacts`: SBOM, build attestation, SBOM attestation

**3. Create Release Job** (depends on prepare, build)

This job publishes the release and deploys the application:

**Key Steps:**
1. **Checkout Main Branch**: Always uses main for deployment consistency
2. **Artifact Download**: Retrieves build and security artifacts
3. **Release Notes Drafting**: Uses release-drafter for automated release notes
4. **GitHub Release Creation**: Creates immutable release with all artifacts
5. **Application Cleanup**: Removes old application files (preserves documentation)
6. **Application Deployment**: Extracts new version to docs directory
7. **GitHub Pages Deployment**: Final deployment of application and documentation

**Release Artifacts:**
- Application zip package
- SPDX SBOM (JSON)
- Build attestation (intoto.jsonl)
- SBOM attestation (intoto.jsonl)

**Deployment Strategy:**
- Clean deployment of application files
- Preservation of documentation
- Version tracking with timestamp markers
- Zero-downtime deployment via GitHub Pages atomic updates

### Release Workflow Permissions

The release workflow uses granular permissions per job:

**Prepare Job:**
- `contents: write` - Required for git auto-commit and tagging

**Build Job:**
- `contents: read` - Repository access
- `id-token: write` - Required for OIDC attestation signing
- `attestations: write` - Required for SBOM and build attestations

**Release Job:**
- `contents: write` - Required to create GitHub releases
- `id-token: write` - Required for OIDC authentication

### SLSA Level 3 Compliance

The release workflow achieves SLSA Level 3 through:

1. **Build Provenance**: Cryptographically signed build attestations
2. **Non-Falsifiable**: OIDC tokens prevent impersonation
3. **Complete SBOM**: Full dependency inventory with versions and licenses
4. **Isolated Build**: Ephemeral environments prevent tampering
5. **Two-Person Review**: Branch protection enforces code review
6. **Retained Indefinitely**: Attestations stored with releases permanently

### Security Hardening Features

All jobs implement StepSecurity Harden Runner with:
- Egress policy auditing
- Network traffic monitoring
- SHA-pinned action versions for immutability
- Minimal permission grants per job
- Comprehensive artifact validation

## ☁️ AWS S3 Deployment Workflow

The AWS S3 deployment workflow (`.github/workflows/deploy-s3.yml`) handles the primary production deployment to AWS infrastructure with CloudFront CDN, providing global content delivery with multi-region resilience.

### Workflow Overview

**Triggers:**
- Push to `main` branch (automatic deployment)
- Permissions: `write-all` (required for AWS operations and GitHub Pages fallback)

**Environment (refer to `.github/workflows/deploy-s3.yml` for current values):**
```yaml
# Example values – see .github/workflows/deploy-s3.yml for authoritative configuration
AWS_REGION: us-east-1
S3_BUCKET_NAME: ciacompliancemanager-frontend-us-east-1-172017021075

```

### Deployment Steps

#### **Step 1: Security Hardening**

Uses **Harden-Runner v2.14.2** with strict egress policy:

```yaml
egress-policy: block  # Default deny all outbound traffic
allowed-endpoints: >  # Explicit allowlist, newline-separated
  sts.us-east-1.amazonaws.com:443
  amazon-cloudfront-secure-static-site-s3bucketroot-14oliw5cmta06.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com:443
  cloudfront.amazonaws.com:443
  cloudformation.us-east-1.amazonaws.com:443
  github.com:443
  api.github.com:443
  objects.githubusercontent.com:443
  registry.npmjs.org:443
  fonts.googleapis.com:443
  fonts.gstatic.com:443
  sonarcloud.io:443
  api.securityscorecards.dev:443
  app.fossa.io:443
  # ... additional endpoints for ZAP, Docker, Mozilla services, etc.
  # See .github/workflows/deploy-s3.yml for complete list (50+ endpoints)
```

**Note:** This snippet is a schematic representation for documentation purposes and does not reflect the exact production configuration. The authoritative egress allowlist in `.github/workflows/deploy-s3.yml` includes 50+ specific endpoints for build tools, security scanners, and infrastructure services. Always refer to the actual workflow file for production deployment configuration.

**Security Benefits:**
- ✅ Prevents data exfiltration from compromised dependencies
- ✅ Limits supply chain attack surface
- ✅ Provides network activity audit trail
- ✅ Enforces least privilege for network access

#### **Step 2: AWS Authentication (OIDC)**

**Configuration:**
```yaml
Role ARN: arn:aws:iam::172017021075:role/GithubWorkFlowRole
Session Name: githubworkflowrolesessiont2  # Production configuration
Region: us-east-1
```

> **Note:** Documents current production workflow configuration (`.github/workflows/deploy-s3.yml` line 101) used for CloudTrail audit logging.

**Authentication Flow:**
1. GitHub Actions requests OIDC token from GitHub's token service
2. Token contains workflow identity (repository, workflow, branch)
3. Token exchanged with AWS STS for temporary credentials
4. Credentials valid for < 1 hour (automatic expiration)
5. No long-lived AWS access keys required

**IAM Role Permissions:**
- `s3:PutObject`, `s3:GetObject`, `s3:ListBucket` (specific bucket only)
- `cloudfront:CreateInvalidation`, `cloudfront:GetDistribution`
- `cloudformation:DescribeStacks` (read-only for distribution ID)

**Compliance Mapping:**
- **ISO 27001 A.9.2**: User access management (role-based)
- **NIST CSF PR.AC-4**: Access control (least privilege)
- **CIS Control 5**: Account management (temporary credentials)

#### **Step 3: S3 Synchronization**

Syncs entire `docs/` directory to S3 bucket:

```bash
aws s3 sync docs/. s3://$S3_BUCKET_NAME/ --exclude ".git/*"
```

**Uploaded Content:**
- HTML files (index.html, documentation pages)
- CSS stylesheets (versioned for long-term caching)
- JavaScript bundles (versioned, code-split)
- Images (WebP, PNG, SVG, favicons)
- Fonts (WOFF, WOFF2)
- Metadata files (sitemap.xml, robots.txt, manifest.json)

**Exclusions (Sync Step):**
- `.git/` directory (version control metadata)

> **Note:** The `screenshots/` directory is **synced to S3 like other assets**, but is **excluded from cache-header rewrite loops** for performance. Large, mostly-static screenshot assets keep their default S3/object headers instead of being iterated over during cache-optimization steps.

#### **Step 4: Cache Header Optimization**

Applies optimized cache headers for each asset type:

**Static Assets (Long-Term Caching):**
```bash
# CSS Files
Cache-Control: public, max-age=31536000, immutable
Content-Type: text/css

# JavaScript Files
Cache-Control: public, max-age=31536000, immutable
Content-Type: application/javascript

# Images (WebP, PNG, JPG, SVG, ICO)
Cache-Control: public, max-age=31536000, immutable
Content-Type: image/webp | image/png | image/jpeg | image/svg+xml

# Fonts (WOFF, WOFF2, TTF)
Cache-Control: public, max-age=31536000, immutable
Content-Type: font/woff2 | font/woff | font/ttf
```

**Dynamic Content (Short-Term Caching):**
```bash
# HTML Files
Cache-Control: public, max-age=3600, must-revalidate
Content-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8

# Metadata Files (XML, JSON, TXT)
Cache-Control: public, max-age=86400
Content-Type: application/xml | application/json | text/plain
```

**Caching Strategy Rationale:**
- **1-Year Cache (CSS/JS/Images/Fonts)**: Versioned assets never change; maximize CDN cache hit rate
- **1-Hour Cache (HTML)**: Balance freshness with performance; content updates visible within 1 hour
- **1-Day Cache (Metadata)**: Sitemaps and robots.txt update infrequently
- **Screenshots Excluded**: Large directory (performance); CloudFront uses S3 defaults

**Performance Benefits:**
- Global edge caching significantly reduces origin requests and improves cache hit ratio
- Faster page load times (assets served from the nearest CloudFront edge location)
- Lower S3 data transfer costs (traffic served from CloudFront cache instead of S3 origin)
- Improved user experience through low-latency asset delivery
- Actual cache hit ratio, latency, and origin request metrics can be monitored via CloudFront analytics and logs

#### **Step 5: CloudFront Cache Invalidation**

**Distribution Discovery:**
```bash
# Query CloudFormation stack for distribution ID
CloudFrontDistId=$(aws cloudformation describe-stacks \
  --stack-name ciacompliancemanager-frontend \
  --query "Stacks[0].Outputs[?OutputKey=='CloudFrontDistributionId'].OutputValue" \
  --output text 2>/dev/null || echo "")

# Fallback: Search distributions by S3 origin (with validation)
if [ -z "$CloudFrontDistId" ]; then
  CloudFrontDistId=$(aws cloudfront list-distributions \
    --output json 2>/dev/null | \
    jq -r ".DistributionList.Items[] | select(.Origins.Items[].DomainName | contains(\"$S3_BUCKET_NAME\")) | .Id" | \
    head -n 1 || echo "")
fi

# Validate result
if [ -z "$CloudFrontDistId" ] || [ "$CloudFrontDistId" = "None" ]; then
  echo "❌ Error: Could not discover CloudFront distribution ID"
  exit 1
fi
```

> **Note:** This snippet is schematic – always refer to `.github/workflows/deploy-s3.yml` for the authoritative implementation.

**Cache Invalidation:**
```bash
aws cloudfront create-invalidation \
  --distribution-id $CloudFrontDistId \
  --paths "/*"
```

**Invalidation Process:**
1. Invalidation request sent to CloudFront API
2. CloudFront marks all edge cache entries as stale
3. Next request to each edge location fetches fresh content from S3
4. New content propagates globally, typically within a few minutes (~5 minutes in most cases)
5. Users see updated content once the invalidation has propagated to their edge location, usually within minutes (significantly reduced cache staleness)

**Why Invalidation is Necessary:**
- Edge caches may have old content (from previous deployment)
- Invalidation accelerates content updates globally, reducing cache staleness from potentially long TTLs to a short propagation window (typically minutes)
- Alternative: Wait for cache expiration (up to 1 year for static assets)
- Cost: First 1,000 invalidations/month free (typically single invalidation per deploy)

### Disaster Recovery Integration

**Primary Deployment:** AWS CloudFront + S3 (this workflow)
**Disaster Recovery:** GitHub Pages (separate workflow, parallel deployment)

**Failover Strategy (Objectives, Not Guarantees):**
1. **Automatic CloudFront Origin Failover**: Target < 5 minutes from incident detection via health checks (origin groups), with user-visible recovery dependent on CloudFront routing propagation
2. **Manual DNS Failover**: Target < 15 minutes for Route53 DNS switch to GitHub Pages, with end-user cutover timing further constrained by DNS TTLs and resolver caching

**RPO/RTO Objectives (Non-Binding Targets):**
- **RPO Objective**: Effectively zero content loss for static artifacts by deploying the same build artifact to AWS and GitHub Pages; actual RPO bounded by time since last successful CI/CD deployment
- **RTO Objective (CloudFront)**: Target service restoration within ~5–10 minutes from incident detection (time to trigger failover + CloudFront routing propagation), measured via AWS monitoring and CloudFront metrics
- **RTO Objective (GitHub Pages DR)**: Target DNS failover completion within ~15 minutes from manual initiation (time to update Route53 + DNS TTL and global resolver propagation)

### Performance Metrics

**Deployment Performance Targets:**

| Metric | Objective (non-binding target) | Measurement Source |
|--------|--------------------------------|--------------------|
| **S3 Sync Time** | Maintain fast deployments for typical content sizes | GitHub Actions workflow duration statistics |
| **Cache Header Application** | Ensure cache headers applied promptly after updates | GitHub Actions logs and S3 object metadata |
| **CloudFront Invalidation** | Aim for global propagation in operationally acceptable timeframe | AWS CloudFront invalidation and performance reports |
| **Total Deployment Time** | Support frequent, incremental changes with fast end-to-end deployment | GitHub Actions workflow run statistics |
| **Cache Hit Rate** | Maintain high cache hit rate appropriate for current content mix | AWS CloudFront cache analytics (AWS Console) |
| **Global Latency (P50)** | Optimize for low median latency for key assets from edge locations | AWS CloudFront performance reports |
| **Global Latency (P99)** | Keep tail latency acceptable for remote regions given current routing | AWS CloudFront performance reports |

**Note:** The values above are illustrative, non-binding objectives. For authoritative metrics, consult GitHub Actions workflow run statistics and AWS CloudFront analytics dashboard.

### Future Enhancements

**Planned Improvements:**
1. **AWS WAF Integration**: Web Application Firewall for threat protection
2. **CloudFront Functions**: Edge compute for dynamic content
3. **Lambda@Edge**: Advanced request/response manipulation
4. **S3 Access Logging**: Detailed access logs for forensics

```

### 🔍 CodeQL Analysis Workflow

Analyzes code for security vulnerabilities using GitHub's CodeQL engine. Runs on:

- Push to main branch
- Pull requests to main branch
- Weekly schedule (Mondays)

The CodeQL workflow uses customized query packs for JavaScript/TypeScript that include:
- Security vulnerability detection
- Code quality issues
- Control flow analysis
- Data flow analysis
- Type checking

Findings are reported directly to the GitHub Security tab with severity ratings and remediation guidance.

### 📦 Dependency Review

Scans dependency manifest changes in pull requests to identify vulnerable packages:

1. Checks for known vulnerabilities in new or updated dependencies
2. Flags vulnerabilities based on severity level
3. Provides remediation advice in PR comments
4. Enforces dependency policy requirements

### ⭐ Scorecard Analysis

Evaluates the project against OSSF security best practices:

1. Branch protection rules
2. Dependency management
3. Code signing
4. Other supply chain security practices

The Scorecard workflow runs weekly and uploads results to the GitHub Security tab, providing:
- Overall security score
- Individual scores for each category
- Improvement recommendations
- Trending information

### 🔆 Lighthouse Audit

Runs performance and best practices audits on the deployed application:

1. Performance metrics
2. Accessibility compliance
3. SEO optimization
4. PWA compatibility
5. Best practices adherence

The workflow uses a budget.json file to define performance budgets and thresholds, uploading results as artifacts and to temporary public storage for viewing.

### 🔒 ZAP Security Scan

Performs dynamic application security testing (DAST) on the deployed application:

1. Identifies common web vulnerabilities
2. API security scanning
3. Checks for OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities
4. Generates comprehensive security reports

ZAP scans are performed using the OWASP ZAP Docker container against the deployed GitHub Pages site to identify runtime security issues that static analysis might miss.

## CI/CD Integration

Performance tests and license checks are integrated with CI/CD pipelines to catch performance regressions and licensing issues.

The integration approach follows a layered security model:

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    PR([Pull Request]) --> Static[Static Analysis]
    Static --> Build[Build & Test]
    Build --> Security[Security Scanning]
    Security --> Deploy[Deploy Preview]
    Deploy --> Audit[Audit & Verify]

    class PR prNode
    class Static,Build,Security,Deploy,Audit phase
```

Each phase adds additional security and quality validation:

1. **Static Analysis**: ESLint, TypeScript, Dependency Review
2. **Build & Test**: Unit tests, E2E tests, Coverage checks
3. **Security Scanning**: CodeQL, License verification
4. **Deploy Preview**: Preview environments, Smoke tests
5. **Audit & Verify**: Lighthouse, ZAP, Accessibility testing

## 🤖 Copilot Setup Steps Workflow

**File:** `.github/workflows/copilot-setup-steps.yml`  
**Triggers:** 
- Manual workflow dispatch
- Push to workflow file
- Pull requests affecting workflow file

**Purpose:** Automates GitHub Copilot workspace environment setup and validation for AI-assisted development workflows.

**Key Steps:**
1. **Checkout Repository**: Securely checks out code with proper permissions
2. **Node.js Environment**: Sets up Node.js 25 with npm caching
3. **Dependency Installation**: Installs project dependencies with `npm ci`
4. **Environment Validation**: Displays Node, npm, and TypeScript versions
5. **Build Artifact Caching**: Caches node_modules and dist directories for performance

**Security Features:**
- Read-only permissions (contents: read)
- SHA-pinned actions for immutability
- Copilot receives separate token for operations

## 📈 Pipeline Analytics & Success Metrics

## 🔄 Rollback Capabilities

The CI/CD pipeline supports rollback to ensure rapid recovery from deployment issues. Currently, rollback is performed manually via workflow dispatch:

### Rollback Triggers

Rollback should be triggered manually when:
- **Deployment Failure**: If a deployment is found to be faulty after release
- **Detected Issues**: If post-deployment monitoring (external to the workflow) identifies critical issues
- **Performance Degradation**: If Core Web Vitals or application performance drops significantly
- **Security Alert**: If a critical vulnerability is discovered in the deployed version
- **Manual Decision**: Rollback initiated via workflow dispatch by an authorized team member

> **Note:** Automated rollback based on health checks, error rates, or performance metrics is not currently implemented in the workflow. All rollbacks require manual initiation via GitHub Actions workflow dispatch.

### Rollback Process

The rollback process follows these steps:

```

### Rollback Implementation

**GitHub Pages Rollback:**
1. **Version Pinning**: Each release is tagged and artifacts are preserved
2. **Automated Reversion**: GitHub Actions can redeploy previous artifact
3. **Asset Preservation**: All build artifacts retained for 90 days
4. **Zero-Downtime**: Uses GitHub Pages atomic deployment model

**Manual Rollback Steps:**
```bash
# 1. Identify the last known good release
gh release list

# 2. Trigger rollback workflow with target version
gh workflow run release.yml -f version=v0.7.0

# 3. Monitor deployment health
gh run watch

# 4. Verify application functionality
npm run test:e2e:prod
```

**Recovery Time Objectives:**
- **Detection Time**: < 5 minutes (manual monitoring or alerts)
- **Decision Time**: < 2 minutes (manual assessment)
- **Rollback Execution**: < 3 minutes (manual workflow trigger)
- **Total RTO**: < 10 minutes from incident detection to recovery

## 🔍 Failure Analysis & Continuous Improvement

The project maintains a systematic approach to analyzing failures and implementing improvements:

### Failure Categories & Mitigation

| Failure Type | Frequency | Root Cause | Mitigation |
|-------------|-----------|------------|------------|
| **Flaky Tests** | 2% | Race conditions in E2E tests | Implemented explicit waits, retry logic |
| **Dependency Issues** | 1% | Breaking changes in updates | Pinned versions, automated testing |
| **Build Timeouts** | < 1% | Resource constraints | Increased timeouts, parallel execution |
| **Security Scan False Positives** | 3% | Tool limitations | Manual review process, suppression rules |
