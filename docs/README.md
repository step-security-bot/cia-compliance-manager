## 🏢 Business Overview

The CIA Compliance Manager is a comprehensive solution designed to help organizations manage and maintain compliance with various security frameworks and standards. The system focuses on the three core principles of information security:

- **Confidentiality**: Ensuring that information is accessible only to those authorized to have access
- **Integrity**: Maintaining the accuracy and completeness of data throughout its lifecycle
- **Availability**: Ensuring that information and systems are available when needed

## 🏛️ Architecture Overview

The CIA Compliance Manager is built with a modular React-based architecture that consists of:

1. **React Component Library and State Management** - Manages the assessment workflow, security state, and interface rendering
2. **Security Framework References and Constants** - Configuration for different compliance frameworks (NIST, ISO, SOC2, etc.)
3. **Dashboard Visualization Components** - Generates compliance visualizations, dashboards, and gap analyses
4. **TypeScript Type System and Interfaces** - Provides type-safe access to all functionality

For detailed architecture diagrams and documentation, see the [Architecture section](https://ciacompliancemanager.com/documentation.html#architecture) in our Documentation Portal. The project also includes [future architecture plans](https://github.com/Hack23/cia-compliance-manager/blob/main/docs/architecture/FUTURE_ARCHITECTURE.md) outlining the roadmap for upcoming enhancements.

## 🔒 Security Features

The application itself is built with security as a priority:

- **Role-Based Access Control** - Granular permissions for different user roles
- **Audit Logging** - Comprehensive logging of all system activities
- **Data Encryption** - All sensitive data is encrypted at rest and in transit
- **Secure Development** - Built following secure coding practices and regular security testing

## 🛡️ DevSecOps Practices

The CIA Compliance Manager follows secure development practices, including:

### GitHub Actions Security

- **Principle of Least Privilege**: Workflows are configured with minimal required permissions
- **Permission Scoping**: Permissions are scoped at the job level rather than workflow level where possible
- **Supply Chain Security**: All releases include SBOM and build provenance attestations
- **Dependency Scanning**: Automated scanning of dependencies for vulnerabilities
- **OpenSSF Scorecard**: Regular security scoring through OpenSSF Scorecard ([View Current Score](https://scorecard.dev/viewer/?uri=github.com/Hack23/cia-compliance-manager))

### Continuous Security Testing

- **SAST**: Static Application Security Testing through CodeQL
- **SCA**: Software Composition Analysis through Dependabot
- **Security Monitoring**: Continuous monitoring of security issues
